# Shortify

Shortify is a web application that allows a user to generate engaging, short-form video content that can be easily shared on their social media(s) of choice. 

This application was designed and made over the course of two weeks, as part of the Le Wagon Tokyo intensive (9-week) Web development bootcamp.

## Usage
- To begin, simply sign up & sign in as a new user, then click on the "start creating" button in the center of the home page, or the "Create" button on the navbar to begin the journey.
- Select a sub-reddit of choice, which will bring up 9 different stories to choose from to use the 'script' of your video.
- Select a background video from the ones we have available, and you may preview the font sizes and options on the right.
- After selecting create video, the generation of your video will begin. This is a background process, so while it might take a while you may look elsewhere on the site if you'd like.
- After around 1-2 minutes, your video should be viewable within "Your Videos", which is accessible via the navbar.
- Your Video shows on the left and has sound when un-muted via the video controls. You also have some AI-generated suggestions for video titles, descriptions and hashtags for social media sharing on the right of the page.
- .. and that's it! Enjoy your video & share as you like!
